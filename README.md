To set the context, we are an independent rental consultancy firm hired by one of the companies above that wishes to extend their presence in the London market. The purpose of this project to help our client in choosing the right market in London (in terms of property type and the location), followed by providing some valuable insights onto how they can increase traffic onto their advertised properties (length of description title and number of reviews).

## Summary:
To start off, we have decided to narrow down the target market for our client by running two initial hypothesis test:
    - Are there any significant price differences between room types?
    - Are there significant price differences between London neighbourhoods?
 
Once we established the target market, we will further explore steps to increase our client's conversionr rate:
    - Is there a statistical significance between number of reviews and price?if so at which levels
    - Is there a statistical significance between length of titles and number of reviews? if so at which levels
