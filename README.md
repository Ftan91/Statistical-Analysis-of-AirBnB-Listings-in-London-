### Setting the Context


**Audience**: AirBnB property management company looking to expand to London market. HostMaker, AirSorted

**Consultancy**: Hired by company above to look for insights to what type of property should they focus on to increase margin / look for regions and room type where better chance of landing higher

Also lay down caveats, costs are fixed, higher number of nights, better

Given your costs are fixed (ie cleaners) we are here to find for you which part of London which may get you higher margins. ie make graph of margin by borough

Once you've picked your, best length to actually set the title and does review actually play a part in this?
