Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. As such, the platform has experienced a surge of property listing which eventually led to emergence of hospitality management companies specializing in managing the end-to-end process of listing an AirBnB property including keys management, professional cleaning, marketing and pricing.

To set the context, we are a independent rental consultancy company hired by one of the companies above that wishes to extend their presence in the London market. The purpose of this project to help our client in choosing the right market in London (in terms of property type and the location), followed by providing some valuable insights onto how they can increase traffic onto their advertised properties (length of description title and number of reviews).

## Null Hypothesis:
- There is no statistical significant price difference between room types.
- There is no statistical significant price difference between London neighbourhoods.
- There is no statistical significant difference between number of reviews and price.
- There is no statistical significant difference between number of reviews and length of listing titles.



We will be using the London airbnb listings database to perform a hypothesis test to answer the following question.
- **Is there a statistical significance between number of reviews and price?if so at which levels**
- **Is there a statistical significance between length of titles and number of reviews? if so at which levels**
- **Are there any significant price differences between room types?**
- **Are there significant price differences between London neighbourhoods?**

### Setting the Context


**Audience**: AirBnB property management company looking to expand to London market. HostMaker, AirSorted

**Consultancy**: Hired by company above to look for insights to what type of property should they focus on to increase margin / look for regions and room type where better chance of landing higher

Also lay down caveats, costs are fixed, higher number of nights, better

Given your costs are fixed (ie cleaners) we are here to find for you which part of London which may get you higher margins. ie make graph of margin by borough

Once you've picked your, best length to actually set the title and does review actually play a part in this?

Convince travellers that pay slightly more to achieve whole house vs hotel room only
